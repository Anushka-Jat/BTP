Interpolated data
Data plots
Clustered
CLuster PCA scores
ICA - experimental



Todo -
1. Add +- 5% error
2. Apply PyCaret model on this for clustering
3. Plot 3D - PCA1, PCA2 and No of days --- seperate graphs for each analyte
4. 70-30 training and testing
5. Use training + Mixture data for new testing for mixture (new notebook)
6. Sensor 4 to be included in all the above


Current data ratio --- 30:49:2.8


New data - 111, 112, 121 etc ratios

'''' CURRENTLY - WE DO NOT HAVE TO WORK WITH SENSOR 4 DATA ''''' 

HIghest conce - 10^-1 dilution ---> dilution = 1
Lowest --- 10^-10 (10 cols) or 10^-8 (8 cols)  ----> dil = 10/8

''' Number of days ka data -- only for Analyte 3, not for 1,2 '''
